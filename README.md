# Career-is-Calling
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
The project will help people find the best fitting job or even calling based on their abilities and qualifications, global or local market situation and trends.

## Background
The rate of technological advances in the world economy forces the manpower to constantly upgrade their skills and knowledge, plan and predict career challenges.
Economic situations may cause temporary layoffs or permanent reductions.
AI algorithms of "Career is Calling" will instantly help individuals find local/remote vocation in current settings or in the future.

## Data and AI techniques
Provisional: Web scraping, crawling; Data preparation and augmentation; Text analysis, NLP; Regression, Classification; Deep Learning and Neural Networks.
The group of applied AI algorithms will continuously analyze global and local industry workforce demand, predict short/long-term employment perspective, analyze state legislature and governmental welfare and employment programmes.
The data is obtained from a wide range of specialized headhunter/employment websites, social networks and chats, official websites of relevant governmental and corporate entities.
"Career is Calling" will scrutinize general trends of position/profession transitions and change-overs, job descriptions, needed personal traits, or even makings. Globally, locally, anonimyzed.
AI algorithm will provide the range of the best possible positions for a person based on education, qualifications, experience, competence, ties and networks, habits and hobbies. Globally, locally, anonimyzed.

## How it is used
"Career is Calling" might be used in high-schools for professional orientation, at the universities for career adjustment, in corporations and institutions as an HR-tool for promotion, rotation and personnel development. By an interested individual as a time-saving advice on how to align personal strengths and aspirations with real-life market trends.

## Challenges
The core algorithm should remain free and open-source. Data validity and anonymization is of utmost importance.

## What next
Social, possibly state-level equal opportunity welfare platform.
I am open for cooperation with programmers and institutions in developing this project into real-life AI solution.
